Coding environment setup:
    Download VS Code from their site:
    - run the setup, check every box, its a microsoft program, there's no addons or viruses
    Download git from their site:
    - run the setup, one specific page has a whole bunch of folder options and stuff, don't even look at it just click next, 
      you basically don't have to click anything on the git setup
      
    Open VS code:
    - under file at the top left, hit open new folder, and select the documents folder of the computer
    - press *ctrl + shift + p*
    - in the search bar type terminal and find "terminal: select default shell"
    - click it, and click git bash terminal in the drop down menu it creates
    
    -now click the x and warning sign in the bottom left corner of the screen, this will pull up a bottom bar of "problems", "output", "terminal", and "debug"
    click terminal if you aren't already there
    - type "git clone https://github.com/WardenclyffeGame/wardenclyffegame.github.io"
    
    - while that's pulling, go to the left sidebar of the screen and hit the symbol with the 3 blocks and one to the side (extensions)
    - type "live serve" and install the plugin the comes up "live server" it has a purple radio signal as its page logo
    - if you want it, type "fold unfold" and install the plugin called "fold/ unfold icone" I know it's misspelled, but it just adds a handy function at the bottom
    
    -adding your github account to vs code:
        - *git config --global user.name ""*
        - *git config --global user.email ""*

    -now, hit file and open new folder again, this time open the folder you cloned, wardenclyffegame.github.io
    -you are now ready to work
    
To open a live server:
    - open the index.html file in vs code, and hit "go live" in the bottom right of the screen, it will automatically open a live tab in your default browser
    
To push any changes made:
    - make sure every file is saved (ctrl + s), 
      you can tell if a file is saved because if there are unsaved changes there will be a white dot next to the name of the file at the top
      
    - *git add -A*
    - *git commit -m ""* 
      (you have to enter a message or it won't commit for you, let's try to stay real with our messages, 
         but i understand if you're frustrated and just want to type some screams) 
    - *git push*
    
    note: if this is your first time pushing on this computer, it will show a pop up to bring you to your browser and sign in officially
          this should only happen once per computer however so no worries. and if it says it cannot redirect you when you sign in, don't worry about it
          VS code doesn't care about the school restrictions and so long as you confirm your account it will push.
